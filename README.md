Summary of Program:
* My program reads data from APIs which have a list of facts for different animes. From these APIs, I ask the user to choose which anime they would like to read a random fact about and print it in the terminal.

Most Challenging topic in the course:
* The introduction of classes was very challenging for me. This is because from coding in global space to structuring classes was something I was not comfortable with until I kept practicing.
